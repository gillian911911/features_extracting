Extract audio features and representations (e.g. mfccs, spectrogram, chromagram)
Classify unknown sounds
Train, parameter tune and evaluate classifiers of audio segments
Detect audio events and exclude silence periods from long recordings
Perform supervised segmentation (joint segmentation - classification)
Perform unsupervised segmentation (e.g. speaker diarization)
Extract audio thumbnails
